## üîß Installation

1. Download the `bond_calculator.py` file
2. Ensure Python 3.6+ is installed on your system
3. Run the program:
   ```bash
   python bond_calculator.py
   ```

## üìñ Usage

Launch the program and navigate using the numbered menu options. The calculator provides a clean, step-by-step interface similar to TI-84 financial calculators.

### Main Menu Options

| Option | Function | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| **1** | Bond Price (Annual) | Calculate present value with annual coupon payments |
| **2** | Bond Price (Semi-Annual) | Calculate present value with semi-annual payments |
| **3** | Macaulay Duration | Weighted average time to receive cash flows |
| **4** | Modified Duration | Interest rate sensitivity measure |
| **5** | Price Change (Duration) | Estimate price change from yield changes |
| **6** | Analytical Convexity | Formula-based convexity calculation |
| **7** | Approximate Convexity | Price difference method convexity |
| **8** | Duration + Convexity | Combined price change estimation |
| **9** | Exit | Close the calculator |

## üí° Example Usage

### Basic Bond Pricing
```
Select option: 1 (Bond Price - Annual)
Annual Coupon ($): 50
Face Value ($): 1000
Yield to Maturity (%): 5
Years to Maturity: 10

Results:
PV of Coupons: $386.09
PV of Principal: $613.91
Bond Price: $1000.00
Current Yield: 5.00%
```

### Duration Calculation
```
Select option: 3 (Macaulay Duration)
Annual Coupon ($): 60
Face Value ($): 1000
Yield to Maturity (%): 6
Years to Maturity: 5
Payments per year: 2

Results:
Bond Price: $1000.00
Macaulay Duration: 4.4651 years
```

## üìê Implemented Formulas

### 1. Bond Price (Present Value)
**Annual:** `PV = Œ£[C/(1+y)^t] + F/(1+y)^N`

**Semi-Annual:** `PV = Œ£[C/m/(1+y/m)^t] + F/(1+y/m)^(N√óm)`

### 2. Macaulay Duration
`MacDur = Œ£[t √ó Ct/(1+y/m)^t] / PV`

### 3. Modified Duration
`ModDur = MacDur / (1 + y/m)`

### 4. Price Change (Duration)
`%ŒîPV ‚âà -ModDur √ó Œîy`

### 5. Analytical Convexity
`Convexity = [1/(PV√ó(1+y/m)¬≤)] √ó Œ£[Ct√ót√ó(t+1)/(1+y/m)^t]`

### 6. Approximate Convexity
`Convexity = (PV‚Åª + PV‚Å∫ - 2√óPV‚ÇÄ) / (PV‚ÇÄ √ó (Œîy)¬≤)`

### 7. Duration + Convexity Adjustment
`%ŒîPV ‚âà (-ModDur √ó Œîy) + (0.5 √ó Convexity √ó (Œîy)¬≤)`

## üéØ Key Variables

| Symbol | Description | Units |
|--------|-------------|-------|
| **PV** | Present Value (Bond Price) | Dollars |
| **C** | Annual coupon payment | Dollars |
| **F** | Face value (par value) | Dollars |
| **y** | Yield to maturity | Decimal (5% = 0.05) |
| **N** | Years to maturity | Years |
| **m** | Coupon payments per year | Integer |
| **t** | Time period | Periods |

## üîç Input Guidelines

- **Monetary Values:** Enter in dollars (e.g., 1000 for $1,000)
- **Percentages:** Enter as whole numbers (e.g., 5 for 5%)
- **Years:** Can be decimal (e.g., 2.5 for 2.5 years)
- **Payment Frequency:** 
  - 1 = Annual
  - 2 = Semi-annual
  - 4 = Quarterly
  - 12 = Monthly

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

1. **Yield Conventions:** The calculator converts percentage inputs to decimals automatically
2. **Payment Timing:** Assumes payments at period end (standard bond convention)
3. **Precision:** Results display to 2-4 decimal places for practical use
4. **Error Handling:** Invalid inputs prompt for re-entry with guidance

## üéì Educational Use

This calculator is ideal for:
- **Finance Students** - Learning bond valuation concepts
- **Investment Professionals** - Quick calculations and verification
- **Academic Research** - Consistent formula implementation
- **CFA/FRM Exam Prep** - Practice with realistic scenarios
